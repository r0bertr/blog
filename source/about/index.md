# HANWEI ZHANG (张 涵玮)

Hi there! I am currently a Ph.D student in [CV/CG Lab](https://www.cvg.ait.kyushu-u.ac.jp/index.html), ISEE, Kyushu University.
My undergraduate school is [School of Data and Computer Science](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/), Sun Yat-sen University.

I am interested in visual computing in 3D.

MOTSLAM first performs multiple object tracking (MOT) with associated both 2D and 3D bounding box detection to create initial 3D objects.|
